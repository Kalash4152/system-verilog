🖥️ SystemVerilog Digital Logic Playground

Welcome to my SystemVerilog Digital Logic Repository 🚀

This repo is a collection of my Digital Logic (DL) practice codes and projects written in SystemVerilog. It is a hands-on journey where I experiment with hardware design, build digital circuits, and simulate them using modern tools. The aim is to strengthen my fundamentals and also create a reference for others learning SystemVerilog.

📚 What You’ll Find Here

This repository contains implementations of various digital building blocks and circuits, including:

🔹 Combinational Circuits

Encoders 🔑

Decoders 🔓

Multiplexers (MUX) & Demultiplexers (DEMUX) 🔀

Priority Circuits ⚡

🔹 Sequential Circuits

Flip-Flops (D, T, JK) ⏱️

Counters (Up, Down, Ring, Johnson) 🔢

Shift Registers ⬅️➡️

Finite State Machines (FSMs) 🌀

🔹 Other Digital Logic Problems

Custom testbenches 🧪

Basic RISC-V introduction experiments 🖧

Small projects like automation circuits 🤖

⚙️ Tools & Workflow

Here’s my setup for coding, simulation, and debugging:

📝 Visual Studio Code (VS Code) → For writing and managing SystemVerilog files

🧑‍💻 Icarus Verilog (iverilog) → For compiling and running SystemVerilog simulations

🌊 GTKWave → For waveform visualization and debugging signal behavior

This workflow helps me design, test, and visualize hardware concepts efficiently
